# Usage

## Table of Content

- [Use in MyShell](#use-in-myshell): directly use the Instant Voice Clone and TTS services.
- [Minimal Demo](#minimal-demo): quickly try OpenVoice and do not require high quality.
- [Linux Install](#linux-install): for researchers and developers only.

## Use in MyShell

For most users, the most convenient way is to directly use the free TTS and Instant Voice Clone services in MyShell.

### TTS

## Linux Install

This section is only for developers and researchers who are familiar with Linux, Python and PyTorch. Clone this repo, and run

```
conda create -n openvoice python=3.9
conda activate openvoice
git clone git@github.com:myshell-ai/OpenVoice.git
cd OpenVoice
pip install -e .
```

Download the checkpoint from [here](https://myshell-public-repo-hosting.s3.amazonaws.com/openvoice/checkpoints_1226.zip) and extract it to the `checkpoints` folder

**1. Flexible Voice Style Control.**
Please see [`demo_part1.ipynb`](../demo_part1.ipynb) for an example usage of how OpenVoice enables flexible style control over the cloned voice.

**2. Cross-Lingual Voice Cloning.**
Please see [`demo_part2.ipynb`](../demo_part2.ipynb) for an example for languages seen or unseen in the MSML training set.

**3. Gradio Demo.**. We provide a minimalist local gradio demo here. We strongly suggest the users to look into `demo_part1.ipynb`, `demo_part2.ipynb` and the [QnA](QA.md) if they run into issues with the gradio demo. Launch a local gradio demo with `python -m openvoice_app --share`.

**3. Advanced Usage.**
The base speaker model can be replaced with any model (in any language and style) that the user prefer. Please use the `se_extractor.get_se` function as demonstrated in the demo to extract the tone color embedding for the new base speaker.

**4. Tips to Generate Natural Speech.**
There are many single or multi-speaker TTS methods that can generate natural speech, and are readily available. By simply replacing the base speaker model with the model you prefer, you can push the speech naturalness to a level you desire.

## Windows Install (VS Code)

Please use [this guide](https://github.com/Alienpups/OpenVoice/blob/main/docs/USAGE_WINDOWS.md) if you want to install and use OpenVoice on Windows.
